# Job Me

![home page](static/images/read-me-images/homepage-update.png)

As part of the Code Institute's October Hackathon, Team 3: The Gig Getters built from scratch a project called **"Job Me"**. This entirely free all-in-one platform was designed to provide Software Developers with a comprehensive suite of resources to help them secure their ideal roles. Tailored to developers of all technical backgrounds, skill levels, and experience, this one-stop-shop simplifies job hunting while offering:

- Mock interview simulations
- Progress tracking tools
- Coding challenges
- Access to key tech stacks like Python, JavaScript, and SQL

With full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionalities, users can easily manage profiles and track progress. It also includes interactive features like a **card carousel** for exploring top interview questions, helping developers deepen their skills in relevant tech stacks.

Built using modern technologies such as **Bootstrap** and **Django**, "Job Me" also provides Users with a **responsive design**, **dark mode toggling**, and **mobile-friendly navigation**. Its dynamic interface ensures developers are well-prepared to pursue roles that align with their career goals.

**Team 3: The Gig Getters** showed immense resilience when faced with the full range of challenges whcih can often come with participating in any hackathon. Obstacles outside of the team's control, such as having a smaller squad than anticipated and reduced capcacity due to injuries, may have slowed us down, but we rose to the challenge.

'In sickness and in health, through good times and bad'  we had each other's backs and key individuals played vital roles in ensuring the product was delivered.
